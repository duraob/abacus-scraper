# Abacus Scraper - Project Context and Progress

## Current State (September 12, 2025)

### Recently Completed
- **NEW: Injuries Scraper (`injuries.py`)** - Successfully implemented and tested
  - Scrapes ESPN NFL injuries page for all 32 teams
  - Extracts player names, positions, injury status, return dates, and comments
  - **Team Mapping Integration**: Automatically converts full team names to standard abbreviations using `team_map.xlsx`
  - Successfully tested with 396 injury records from 32 teams
  - Outputs clean CSV data to `data/` directory with team abbreviations (ARI, ATL, BAL, etc.)
  - Uses undetected Chrome driver to avoid bot detection
  - Includes proper error handling and logging

- **ENHANCED: Projection Engine (`projection.py`)** - Updated with injury filtering
  - **Injury Integration**: Automatically excludes players who are "Out" or "Injured Reserve" from projections
  - **Smart Filtering**: Loads injury data from `data/injuries.csv` and removes unavailable players
  - **Improved Accuracy**: Projections now only include healthy, available players
  - **Seamless Integration**: Works automatically with existing projection workflow
  - Successfully tested excluding 255 injured players from active roster

### Existing Components
- **NFL Data Scraper (`nfl_data.py`)** - Fully functional
  - Scrapes Pro Football Reference for game statistics
  - Uses schedule-based approach for efficiency
  - Handles player stats, team data, and game information
  - Includes caching and retry logic

- **Other Components** - Various analysis and projection tools
  - Season projector
  - Stats agent
  - Picks agent
  - Telegram bot integration
  - Insights formatter

## Technical Implementation Details

### Injuries Scraper Architecture
- **Page Retrieval**: Uses undetected Chrome driver to access ESPN
- **HTML Parsing**: BeautifulSoup for reliable data extraction
- **Data Structure**: ESPN uses `Table__Title` and `Table__TBODY` classes
- **Team Identification**: Extracts team names from `injuries__teamName` spans
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with detailed logging
- **Output Format**: CSV with timestamped filenames

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Selector Strategy**: Used double underscore classes (`Table__Title`, `injuries__teamName`)
2. **Table Navigation**: Found tables within `Table__ScrollerWrapper` containers
3. **Data Extraction**: Parsed 5-column structure (Name, Pos, Est. Return Date, Status, Comment)
4. **Caching**: 6-hour cache for injury data (changes frequently)
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## What We Need to Work on Next

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Integration Testing**: Test how injuries data integrates with existing analysis tools
2. **Data Validation**: Add validation to ensure data quality and completeness
3. **Scheduling**: Set up automated runs for regular data collection
4. **Error Recovery**: Enhance error handling for network issues or page changes

### Future Enhancements
1. **Data Analysis**: Create injury trend analysis and impact assessments
2. **Alert System**: Notify when key players' injury status changes
3. **Historical Tracking**: Track injury patterns over time
4. **API Integration**: Connect with other NFL data sources
5. **Dashboard**: Create a web interface for viewing injury data

### Technical Debt
1. **Code Organization**: Consider refactoring common scraping patterns
2. **Configuration**: Move hardcoded values to configuration files
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests for parsing functions
4. **Documentation**: Expand inline documentation for complex functions
