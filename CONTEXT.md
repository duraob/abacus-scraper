# Project Progress

## Current State
- Basic web scraping functionality implemented using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4
- Added file-based caching system to optimize testing and development
- Cache system includes automatic expiration after 24 hours

## Recent Changes
- Implemented caching system in `get_soup` function
- Created cache directory for storing scraped data
- Added cache validation with expiration
- Updated documentation in README.md
- Refactored get_game_data: now collects player data in a list of dicts and creates a DataFrame at the end, improving efficiency and maintainability.
- Added robust error handling and retry logic for web requests: failed requests are retried up to 3 times, errors are logged, and the script continues gracefully if a page cannot be fetched.
- Added a success message for each successfully retrieved page and logic to re-initialize the web driver after max retries. If the page fails again after re-initialization, the program exits.

## Next Steps
Potential improvements could include:
- Add cache clearing functionality
- Implement concurrent scraping for multiple pages
- Add data processing and analysis features
- Implement error recovery and retry mechanisms
