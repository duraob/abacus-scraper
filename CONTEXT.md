## Recent Accomplishments

### Weekly Progression NFL Projection Engine - COMPLETED ✅
**File**: `projection.py`

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Week-Based Data Selection**: Automatically selects appropriate historical data based on projection week
- **Time-Weighted Analysis**: Uses most recent 10 games with exponential time decay weighting
- **Recent Performance Emphasis**: Most recent games get highest weight (1.0), older games decay to 0.1
- **Dynamic Data Mixing**: 
  - Week 1: 10 games from 2024 (no 2025 data yet)
  - Week 2: 9 games from 2024 + 1 game from 2025
  - Week 3+: Available 2025 weeks + remaining from 2024
- **Weighted Aggregation**: All team and player statistics use time-weighted calculations
- **Clean Architecture**: Straightforward implementation without backward compatibility complexity

**Technical Implementation:**
- **`create_time_weighted_dataset_dynamic()`**: Dynamically selects data based on projection week
- **Enhanced `build_team_statistics()`**: Applies proper time-weighted aggregation using normalized weights
- **Enhanced `create_player_dataset_from_game_data()`**: Applies proper time-weighted aggregation and consolidates by current team
- **`create_player_team_mapping()`**: Maps players to their current team from master roster
- **`run_with_time_weighted_data()`**: Main function for time-weighted projections
- **Parameter-Based Filename Generation**: Creates separate files for each week (week1, week2, etc.)
- **Corrected Weighting Logic**: Fixed mathematical error in time-weighted aggregation (was causing 94% under-projection)

**Output Quality:**
- **Week 1**: 371 active players using 10 games from 2024 (consolidated by current team)
- **Week 2**: 427 active players using 9 games from 2024 + 1 from 2025 (consolidated by current team)
- **32 teams** with time-weighted statistics (data quality fixed)
- **Complete Schedule Integration**: Updated to use `data/nfl-2025-EasternStandardTime.csv` with all 18 weeks
- **Opponent Determination**: Week 2+ projections now properly determine next opponents for matchup-based adjustments
- **Player Consolidation**: Players who switched teams (e.g., Aaron Rodgers: NYJ→PIT) appear only once with their current team
- **Realistic Projections**: QB pass attempts now project 20-35 per game (was 0.4-2.1 before fix)
- **Recent trends emphasized** - 2025 Week 1 has 10x more influence than 2024 Week 9
- **Performance trends captured** - recent form has higher impact on projections
- **Data integrity maintained** - all existing functionality preserved

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Default time-weighted projections (2025 Week 1 + 2024 Weeks 9-17)
python projection.py

# With custom schedule and week
python projection.py --time-weighted data/nfl-2025-EasternStandardTime.csv 1
```

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Active Roster Monitoring**: Monitor name matching between roster and game data for accuracy
2. **Performance Validation**: Verify that filtered projections are more accurate than unfiltered versions
3. **Weekly Roster Updates**: Ensure master roster is updated weekly to reflect current active players
4. **Result Tracking**: Monitor projection accuracy with active roster filtering vs historical performance

### Future Enhancements
1. **Opponent-Specific Analysis**: Enhance trend analysis with actual opponent matchup data
2. **Historical Performance Tracking**: Monitor how well the nuggets perform over time
3. **Customizable Thresholds**: Allow users to adjust sample size and delta percentage filters
4. **Position-Specific Analysis**: Add specialized analysis for QBs, RBs, WRs, TEs
5. **Weather Integration**: Factor in weather conditions for outdoor games

### Technical Debt
- **RESOLVED**: File conflict between stats_agent.py and picks_agent.py output files
  - stats_agent.py now saves to `data/fun_stats/stats_insights_week_XX.json`
  - picks_agent.py continues to save to `data/insights/grok_insights_week_XX.json`
  - Clear separation of concerns: statistical insights vs betting recommendations
- None currently identified - the method-based approach is clean and maintainable
- All functions follow .cursorrules principles for modularity and testability
