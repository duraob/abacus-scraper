## üöÄ Weekly Data Pipeline

### Step 1: Collect Fresh NFL Data
```bash
# Scrape current season game data from Pro Football Reference (NEW OPTIMIZED VERSION)
python nfl_data.py 2025

# Or use legacy scraper
python pfr_scraper.py
```
**Output**: `data/game_data_2025.csv` - Complete player performance data

**New Features in nfl_data.py**:
- **Undetected Chrome Driver**: Bypasses Cloudflare protection
- **Method-Based Architecture**: Clean, modular, testable functions
- **Intelligent Caching**: 24-hour cache system for faster development
- **Retry Logic**: Robust error handling with automatic retries
- **Year Parameter**: Run with any year: `python nfl_data.py 2024`
- **Target Format Compliance**: Output matches exact CSV structure
- **Schedule-Based Scraping**: Efficient single-page approach vs team-by-team
- **Mathematical Snap Counts**: Calculated from pass attempts + rushes
- **Position Extraction**: Accurate player positions from snap count tables
- **Clean Weather Data**: Proper weather text extraction from game info
- **Team Assignment**: Correct player-to-team mapping

### Step 2: Generate Fantasy Projections
```bash
# Generate projections with active roster filtering
python nfl_proj.py --game-data data/game_data_2024.csv nfl2025sched.csv 1
```
**What it does**:
- Loads active roster from `data/master_roster.xlsx`
- Filters to active players only (eliminates injured/inactive noise)
- Creates team-level statistics with schedule strength normalization
- Generates fantasy football projections based on opponent matchups

**Output**: 
- `data/projections/nfl25_proj_week0.csv` - Fantasy projections
- `nfl25_team.csv` - Team statistics
- `nfl25_players.csv` - Player statistics

### Step 3: Collect Betting Odds
```bash
# Scrape current week's betting odds
python odds.py
```
**What it does**:
- Determines current NFL week from schedule
- Collects team odds (spreads, totals, moneyline)
- Gathers player props (passing, rushing, receiving stats)
- Organizes data by week in structured directories

**Output**: 
- `data/odds/week_01/team_odds_week_01.csv`
- `data/odds/week_01/player_props_week_01.csv`

### Step 4: AI-Powered Betting Analysis
```bash
# Generate AI-powered betting recommendations
python picks_agent.py
```
**What it does**:
- Compares projections to betting lines to find mathematical edges
- Uses live search to gather injury reports, news, and expert insights
- Sends top opportunities to Grok AI for intelligent analysis
- Returns top 10 betting recommendations with reasoning

**Output**: 
- `data/insights/grok_insights_week_01.json` - AI betting recommendations

### Step 5: Historical Trend Analysis
```bash
# Generate statistical insights and fun facts
python stats_agent.py
```
**What it does**:
- Analyzes 9 seasons of historical data (2016-2024)
- Compares player performance trends to current betting lines
- Identifies statistical anomalies and betting opportunities
- Generates ESPN-style insights using Grok AI

**Output**: 
- `data/nuggets/nuggets_week_01.json` - Raw statistical data
- `data/fun_stats/stats_insights_week_01.json` - AI-enhanced statistical insights
